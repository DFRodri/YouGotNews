# YouGotNews - Stage 1+2
<p>Project #6 of the Android Basics Nano-Degree</p>

### Short Description

<p>They asked us, students, to design something that could look like a news app of a certain theme with the <i>The Guardian API</i> as a base.</p>
<p>Use of libraries was forbidden so creativity was also needed a bit to achieve some results.</p>

## How it works

<p>Simple APP that shows the news of a certain theme/section.</p>
<p>It makes use of the action bar to implement refresh,an intent to go the credits page, and even a fragment with settings.</p>
<p>Navigation up in the action bar is also implemented.</p>
<p>It takes into consideration the time zone of the user to prevent news to show in the future.</p>

## Here are some screenshots
